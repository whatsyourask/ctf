Use volatility as it is a memory dump. Identifying profile:

```bash
~/tools/volatility/volatility_2.6_lin64_standalone -f WIN-LQS146OE2S1-20201027-142607.raw imageinfo

The challenge description says that the attackers did something on the machine. So, the right way to think is some command line activity. Thus, the right option is cmdscan.

```bash
~/tools/volatility/volatility_2.6_lin64_standalone -f WIN-LQS146OE2S1-20201027-142607.raw --profile Win7SP1x64 cmdscan

Here, we see that the attackers wrote the link to a file, which they wanted, I think, to execute later. The link is a base64 encoded flag.
